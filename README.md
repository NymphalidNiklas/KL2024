# **Molecular Phylogenetics, South China Agricultural University**

Teachers Jadranka Rota and Niklas Wahlberg

## **Introduction**

In this course we will learn in practice how to download data from GenBank, create a multigene dataset, and analyse the dataset using maximum likelihood. We will also hear about how we can use museum specimens for molecular analyses, in particular whole genome sequencing.

## **Schedule**

**Location:** South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou
