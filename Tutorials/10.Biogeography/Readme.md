# Ancestral area reconstruction

Historical biogeography is a field in which we try to understand the evolutionary history of a clade as it relates to the changes in distribution of the species (and their ancestors) over time. In essence, we estimate the ancestral species ranges on a time-calibrated tree. 

We will carry out such an analysis on our Felidae dataset using an R package [BioGeoBEARS](https://github.com/nmatzke/BioGeoBEARS) and the so-called DEC model (dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis) ([Ree et al. 2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb00940.x), [Ree & Smith 2008](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/57/1/4/1703014)).

To carry out such an analysis, in addition to a time-calibrated tree, we also need the information on the current distribution of the species in our clade of interest, as well as some information on the possibility of dispersal between the different areas relevant for our dataset.

BioGeoBEARS requires a table with the species distribution data formatted in a specific way:

```
42	5 (O	AT	PA	N	NT)
CM017348_Lynx_canadensis	00010
HM185183_Prionailurus_bengalensis	10100
JF357970_Panthera_tigris_sumatrae	10000
JF357972_Panthera_tigris_corbetti	10000
KJ508413_Panthera_tigris	10100
KJ866876_Panthera_pardus_japonensis	10000
KM236783_Panthera_onca	00001
KP001495_Panthera_leo	01000
KP001507_Panthera_pardus	01100
```

This format loosely resembles the PHYLIP file format that you used with your alignments: in the first line we see the dimensions of the data, meaning the number of taxa that this dataset includes and the areas defined. Finally, within the parantheses, we see the labels for the five geographical areas that we chose. We are going with these large biogeographical areas because many of the cat species are quite widely distributed, and we can leave out Australia because there are no naturally occurring cats there.

They are:
+ O: Oriental
+ AT: Afrotropical
+ PA: Palaearctic
+ N : Nearctic
+ NT: Neotropical


Apart from these two files, we need some other files that define some of the parameters or constraints of the models we are going to use. BioGeoBEARS has several options for creating different models for how ancestral ranges evolved in a group of organisms. For example, one can define which areas are allowed by including an [areas-allowed matrix](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#areas_allowed_matrix2). One can also have an [area-adjacency matrix](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#areas_adjacency_matrix2). What we will use in our analysis are the so-called [dispersal multipliers](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#dispersal_multipliers2) in the form of a _dispersal multiplier matrix_. This is a table that modifies the probability of dispersal between different areas. In our case, for example, we don't expect that the probability of dispersal from the Oriental Region into the Neotropical Region is the same as the probability of dispersal from the Nearctic into the Neotropics. 

Example dispersal multiplier matrix (made pretty for readability):

```
O         AT      PA       N      NT
1       0.01       1    0.01    0.01
0.01       1    0.01    0.01    0.01
1       0.01       1       1    0.01
0.01    0.01       1       1       1
0.01    0.01    0.01       1       1

END

```

Furthermore, we can also create a time-stratified model. We know that the position of continents and the existence of various barriers or land bridges has changed over time. This information can be incorporated into our model by using a _time periods_ file as well as _dispersal multiplier matrices_ that are different for each time period. For our dataset, we will divide our tree into three sections, going from the root of the tree: 20-5 million years ago (mya), 5-2 mya, and 2-0 mya. The file with this information is called _time periods_.

We also need to decide on the maximum number of areas that one species (as well as the ancestors) is allowed to occupy in our models. Looking at our tip data, there is one species that is present in all areas and that is the domestic cat _Felis catus_. However, this species became cosmopolitan with the help of humans and it makes this analysis more difficult so we decided to remove that tip (and the associated entry from the species distribution data). Looking at all of the other species, at most they are present in two areas so we want to set the maximum number of areas to 2. That way we limit the total number of area combinations that need to be explored by the model to 16 versus 32.

You can download the pruned tree without the cat tip and all the other files we will need for this tutorial from [here](../../Data/Day4/Biogeography/). 


--------------------

## Using BioGeoBEARS

### Installation 

First we should start by installing the required R package if you haven't done so already. To do that, open RStudio (or launch R the way you normally use it) and type the following command into your console:

```R
install.packages("rexpokit")
install.packages("cladoRcpp")
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then we will install BioGeoBEARS from GitHub.

```R
devtools::install_github(repo="nmatzke/BioGeoBEARS")
```

If R asks you if you want to update some packages first, you can just hit enter without typing anything and it should skip updating packages.
This installation will do try to compile some packages so it is likely that it will take some time or fail altogether. If you are stuck at this step, just ask for help and we will try to solve the problem together.


### Running DEC models

we should start by running the following line of code by copying and pasting. This will allow you to use a wrapper function to use BioGeoBEARS in a more user friendly way.

```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NymphalidNiklas/EB2_2023/main/Data/Day4/Biogeography/run_dec_f.R")
```

This wrapper function has several arguments we need to pass values to:

```R
run_dec = function(treefile, ## Path to your tree file
                   geofile,  ## Path to your species distribution data file
                   multiplierfile, ## Path to file that include multiplier matrices
                   adjacencyfile=NULL, ## Not used
                   maxrange=2, ## Maximum number of areas a species allowed to occupy during modeling
                   timesfile, ## File with time periods defined to use it in time-stratified analyses
                   distmatrixfile=NULL, ## Not used
                   resultsfile, ## filename to save your model fit results, should end with ".RData"
                   section=FALSE, ## Set this to true if you are doing a time-stratified analysis
                   areasfile=NULL ## Not used
    )
```

#### DEC with no time stratification

The first model that we are going to run is a simple model with just one dispersal rate multiplier matrix that doesn't change over time (no time stratification as explained above). Have a look at the values in the table and think about whether they make sense given the current position of continents and the large barriers to dispersal (e.g., Sahara dessert, oceans).


|    | O    | AT   | PA   | N    | NT   |
|----|------|------|------|------|------|
| O  | 1    | 0.01 | 1    | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| AT | 0.01 | 1    | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| PA | 1    | 0.01 | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| N  | 0.01 | 0.01 | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| NT | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.01 | 1    | 1    |


To model DEC0, you can use the wrapper function like the example below (Assuming that you have downloaded all the required files)"

```R
run_dec(treefile = "FelidaeTimes_pruned_no_F_catus.tre", geofile = "Felidae_biogeo_data.txt",
        multiplierfile = "DEC0_dispersal_multipliers_no_time_strat.txt", maxrange = 2, timesfile = "time_periods.txt",
        resultsfile = "DEC0_result.Rdata", section=FALSE)
```

After successfully running the code above, you should see a new file saved to your working directory named `DEC0_result.Rdata`. 

#### DEC with alternative time stratification configurations

The files that start with `DEC*_dispersal_multipliers` are the alternative time stratificaiton configurations. Can you figure out how to run three additional DEC models with the configurations DEC1, DEC2, and DEC3 using the wrapper function?

### Summarizing and visualizing the results

When you run the code block has `source()` above, you should get two additional functions apart from the wrapper `run_dec()` function. These are `plot_models()` and `get_table()`. We will use these functions to compare our models. But first, we need to load the results from the results files. Assuming that you specified `resultsfile="DEC0_results.Rdata"`, `resultsfile="DEC1_results.Rdata"`, etc for DEC0, DEC1:

```R
load("DEC0_results.Rdata")
res_DEC0 = res

load("DEC1_results.Rdata")
res_DEC1 = res

load("DEC2_results.Rdata")
res_DEC2 = res

load("DEC3_results.Rdata")
res_DEC3 = res
```

Try this:

```R
results = list(res_DEC0, res_DEC1, res_DEC2, res_dec3)
get_table(results) 
```

To compare two models, we can do:

```R
LnL_2 = get_LnL_from_BioGeoBEARS_results_object(res_DEC2)
LnL_1 = get_LnL_from_BioGeoBEARS_results_object(res_DEC0)

stats = AICstats_2models(LnL_1, LnL_2, 2, 2)
stats
```

To plot the ancestral area resonctructions, we can use `plot_models()`:

```R
plot_models(res_DEC0, "DEC0")
```

You can also save this to a PDF file by:

```R
pdf("DEC0_plot.pdf", 10, 10)
plot_models(res_DEC0, "DEC0")
dev.off()
```

Plot each of our four models with the function `plot_models()` and save them to their own pdf files.

### Discussion

Hopefully you managed to run the analyses and you got your tree file with the ancestral areas inferred. If not, you can get these files from [here](../../Data/Day4/Biogeography/Results). There are two kinds of plots: i) where the most likely area or area combination is shown at each node and ii) with pie charts showing the probability of the most likely states.

Questions:

1. Which model is the best fit to the data?
2. Are the ancestral area reconstructions the same across the different models?
3. Can you identify some range expansions (i.e., dispersal events)?
4. And can you identify some range extinctions, i.e. where the ancestor was widely distributed but it then went extinct in one of the ranges (range contraction)?
5. Finally, can you identify an inferred vicariance event?
